Experimental Matlab mex support for multi-core Intel ICC/MKL code

Allows one to call the rsvd functions from a mex-file interface. I.e. in 
bash shell:

$ source setup_vars.sh
$ ./compile_mex.sh

then run matlab and use one of the provided interface functions:

$ matlab -nodesktop 
>> A = randn(2000,5000);
>> k = 1900;
>> [U,S,V] = rsvd_mkl_mex_interface1(A,k);
>> norm(A - U*S*V')/norm(A)
>> k = 2000;
>> [U,S,V] = rsvd_mkl_mex_interface2(A,100,20,2);
>> norm(A - U*S*V')/norm(A) 

Important: setup_vars.sh must be sourced in shell from which matlab is called. 
compile_mex.sh and setup_vars.sh must be modified to reflect system settings 
(i.e. path to matlab, icc/mkl, etc). 
MKL likely needs to be warmed up prior to SVD call as done 
in rsvd_mex_interface1.m script, otherwise a crash 
may occur. The interface between MKL code with OpenMP and Matlab mex may  
not be stable. Adjustments may be needed for different software versions. 
Tested with Matlab R2015a, icc 14.0.3.
