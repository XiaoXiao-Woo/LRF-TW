Experimental Matlab mex support for NVIDIA GPU CULA code

Allows one to call the rsvd functions from a mex-file interface. I.e. in 
bash shell:

$ source setup_vars.sh
$ ./compile_mex.sh
$ matlab -nodesktop 
>> A = randn(2000,5000);
>> k = 1900;
>> [U,S,V] = rsvd_cula_mex_interface1(A,k);
>> norm(A - U*S*V')/norm(A)
>> k = 2000;
>> [U,S,V] = rsvd_cula_mex_interface2(A,100,20,2);
>> norm(A - U*S*V')/norm(A) 

Important: setup_vars.sh must be sourced in shell from which matlab is called. 
compile_mex.sh and setup_vars.sh must be modified to reflect system settings 
(i.e. path to matlab, cuda/cula, etc). 
The interface between CUDA/CULA code and matlab mex may not be stable. 
Adjustments may be needed for different software versions. Tested 
with Matlab R2015a, cula R18, cuda 6.5.
