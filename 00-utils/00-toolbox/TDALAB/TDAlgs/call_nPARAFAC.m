%opts.
% tol - Convergence criterion
%            The relative change in fit for which the algorithm stops.
%            Standard is 1e-6, but difficult data might require a lower value.
%
% initmode - Initialization method
%            This option is ignored if PARAFAC is started with old values.
%            If no default values are given the default value is 0.
%            The advantage of using DTLD or SVD for initialization is that
%            they often provide good starting values. However, since the
%            initial values are then fixed, repeating the fitting will give
%            the exact same solution. Therefore it is not possible to substantiate
%            if a local minimum has been reached. To avoid that use an initialization
%            based on random values (2).
%
%            0  = fit using DTLD/GRAM for initialization (default if
%                                 three-way and no missing and if sizes are
%                                 largere than number of factors at least
%                                 in two modes)
%            1  = fit using SVD vectors for initialization (default if higher than three-way or missing)
%            2  = fit using random orthogonalized values for initialization
%            10 = fit using the best-fitting models of several models
%            fitted using a few iterations
%
% Scaling
%            0 or 1 = default scaling (columns in mode one carry the variance)
%            2      = no scaling applied (hence fixed elements will not be modified
%
% showFit - How often to show fit
%            Determines how often the deviation between the model and the data
%            is shown. This is helpful for adjusting the output to the number
%            of iterations. Default is 10. If showfit is set to NaN, almost no
%            outputs are given
%
% maxiter - Maximal number of iterations
%            Maximal number of iterations allowed. Default is 2500.
% const      A vector telling type of constraints put on the loadings of the
%            different modes. Same size as DimX but the i'th element tells
%            what constraint is on that mode.
%            0 => no constraint,
%            1 => orthogonality
%            2 => nonnegativity
%            3 => unimodality (and nonnegativitiy)
%            4 => L1 fitting (will be imposed in all modes)
%            5 => L1 fitting and nonnegativity (will be imposed in all modes)
%            If const is not defined, no constraints are used.
%            For no constraints in a threeway problem const = [0 0 0]
% FixMode    FixMode is a binary vector of same sixe as DimX. If
%            FixMode(i) = 1 => Mode i is fixed (requires old values given)
%            FixMode(i) = 0 => Mode i is not fixed hence estimated
%            Ex.: FixMode = [0 1 1] find the scores of a data set given the loadings.
%            When some modes are fixed, the numbering of the components will
%            also be fixed. Normally components are sorted according to variance
%            as in PCA, but this will not be performed if some modes are fixed.
%
% Weights    If a matrix of the same size as X is given, weighted regression
%            is performed using the weights in the matrix Weights. Statistically
%            the weights will usually contain the inverse error standard
%            deviation of the particular element
%      >>>>>> Please specify a mat-file which defines a matrix named as
%            'Weights'
