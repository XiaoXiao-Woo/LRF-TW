Datafiles for testing are available in [TDALAB benchmark](http://bsp.brain.riken.jp/~zhougx/tdalab/TDALAB_benchmark.zip) \[~30MB\].

Tensor Toolbox (TDALAB) provides fundamental data structures and functions for tensor data processing. TDALAB attempts to provide an easy to use, user-friendly toolbox for experimentation and application of tensor decomposition and analysis.

#### TDALAB highlights and features

*   friendly graphical user interface (GUI) for tensor decompositions, enabling easy selection of decomposition model, algorithm, and parameters
*   platform for comparison and evaluation of a large number of state-of-the-art tensor decomposition algorithms, and provides friendly GUI to access the widely used functions included in [N-way Toolbox](http://www.models.life.ku.dk/nwaytoolbox) and [Tensor Toolbox](http://www.sandia.gov/~tgkolda/TensorToolbox/), and some of the latest developments in tensor decompositions.
*   implementation of constrained tensor decomposition by incorporating standard 2D Penalized Matrix Factorization (PMF) methods in order to impose diversity/constraints on components (columns of factor matrices), such as orthogonality, statistical independence, sparsity, nonnegativity, etc (as in [Multilinear Blind Source Separation (MBSS)](http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/bpasts.2012.60.issue-3/v10175-012-0051-4/v10175-012-0051-4.xml)).
*   implementation of 2D constrained matrix factorization (also referred to as 2D Blind Source Separation (BSS))
*   multiple visualization approaches for tensor objects are provided, users can explore the components and their connections
